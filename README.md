## Description
Big step up from Pong and Breakout. This project required a lot more work and took me a total of about 4 days of work to complete. With this being my 3rd game now, I'd say I'm getting much more comfortable with the engine and the "Unity" way of doing things. This one required some rudimentary AI behavior, a lot more state management, and a lot more UI interaction.
